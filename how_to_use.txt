# When the program stopped and you want to restart it:
1. open the Terminal
2. cd C:\Users\erhard\Documents\gemini
3. python3 src/main.py
	Hit enter and wait until the process starts. This may take a few seconds ... even a minute

# When you want to stop the program
Ctrl+C in terminal

# When you want to run the program in another PC:
1. copy the following folders and file to your USB
	- src
	- text
		* but it is not necessary to copy all the files in the folder
	- pybo/dialect_packs/custom
		* This folder is usually located under your 'Document' folder.
	- requirements.txt
2. open the Explore in another PC and navigate to the folder in which you want to run the program.
3. create a folder named 'gemini' and further create folders named 'conllu' and 'output' under the folder 'gemini'.
4. make sure if python is executable in the PC. If not, install it.
5. open the terminal and navigate to the folder 'gemini' and run the following command
	- python -m venv venv
	- source venv/bin/activate
		* for Windows: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
	- pip install -r requirements.txt
6. run the following command in terminal:
	- pip install --upgrade google-cloud-aiplatform
	- gcloud auth application-default login
	* If you get an error message, follow the instruction.
7. run the following command under the folder 'gemini':
	- python3 src/main.py
	* alternatively, python src/main.py
8. The programm executed in step 7 will stop (if it does not stop, stop it by Ctrl+C). Then place the custom under document/pybo/dialect_packs, and run the programm again like in step 7.
* If you got the following error, do steps 8.1-8.4:

	8.1. visit the following page in google clould:
		- https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?hl=de
	8.2. click on ... in 'Sie arbeiten in ...'
	8.3. copy ID of the project name you use.
	8.4. change vertex = VertexAI() in src/main.py to vertex = VertexAI(project=...). ... should be the project ID you coped in step 8.3.
